 This repository contains the code for the backend of our e-commerce website where i use javascript,async programming mongodb for database and express for ease to work.
 
This backend code is responsible for retrieving product information from our database and delivering it to the frontend for display. It uses a RESTful API to communicate with the frontend, and queries the database using NOSQL commands to fetch the relevant product data. The code also includes error handling to ensure that invalid requests or database errors are properly handled.

Once the product data is retrieved from the database, the code formats it into a JSON response that is returned to the frontend. The response includes information such as the product name, description, price, and availability. The code can also handle pagination and filtering of products based on various criteria such as category, price range, or availability.

To ensure the security of our system, the code includes authentication and authorization mechanisms to ensure that only authorized users can access the product data. It also uses best practices for secure database access and data handling.

Overall, this backend code provides a reliable and efficient way to retrieve product information from our database and deliver it to the frontend for display.
